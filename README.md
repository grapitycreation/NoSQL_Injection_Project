## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 NoSQL Overview
#### 1.1.1 What is NoSQL?
NoSQL, short for 'Not only SQL' or 'Non-SQL', is a type of database that does not use the relational table model like traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Instead, NoSQL stores and manages data in various models, such as key-value pairs (JSON, BSON), documents, columns, or graphs, enhancing scalability and performance for modern applications.
